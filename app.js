/*
Instructions
============

Let's make a dice rolling app!

This app has 2 functions:
	1. Click 'Add die!' to add new a die with a default value of "1".
	2. Click 'Roll dice!' to roll all the dice and display a number between "1" and "6".


Hints:
- Watch the preview.mov file to see how the final product might look.
- Feel free to use (or not use) jQuery. It's already included in app.html
- There's already a styled 'die' class in app.html

Bonus:

Add an output below which displays the sum of all the dice

$(document).ready(function() {
    // Your code goes here..
